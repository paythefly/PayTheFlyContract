Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n * reused.

This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n *\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker.

Function declares returns(bool) but returns nothing\n *   }\n *   ```\n *\n * In Solidity 0.4.x, missing return statements default to returning 0 (false).\n * The compiled bytecode returns 32 bytes of zeros instead of true.\n *\n * ============================================================================\n * WHY OPENZEPPELIN SAFEERC20 DOESN'T WORK\n * ============================================================================\n *\n * OpenZeppelin SafeERC20 uses this logic (v5.x):\n *\n *   ```solidity\n *   // returnSize == 0 means no return data (old non-returning tokens)\n *   // returnValue must be 1 (true) if data is returned\n *   if (returnSize == 0 ? address(token).code.length == 0 : returnValue != 1) {\n *       revert SafeERC20FailedOperation(address(token));\n *   }\n *   ```\n *\n * OpenZeppelin handles:\n *   ✅ Standard tokens that return true (returnSize > 0, returnValue == 1)\n *   ✅ Old tokens that return nothing (returnSize == 0)\n *   ❌ Buggy tokens like TRON USDT (returnSize > 0, returnValue == 0)\n *\n * TRON USDT declares `returns (bool)` so the EVM/TVM allocates return space,\n * resulting in returnSize > 0, but the actual value is 0 (false).\n *\n * ============================================================================\n * OUR SOLUTION: Balance Verification\n * ============================================================================\n *\n * Instead of trusting return values, we verify transfers by checking balance changes:\n *\n *   1. Record balance before transfer\n *   2. Execute transfer (ignore return value)\n *   3. Verify balance increased by expected amount\n *\n * This approach is:\n *   ✅ More reliable - doesn't depend on return value implementation\n *   ✅ Universal - works with ANY token regardless of bugs\n *   ✅ Cross-chain - works on both EVM (Ethereum, BSC, etc.) and TVM (TRON)\n *   ⚠️ Slightly higher gas - requires extra balanceOf() calls\n *\n * ============================================================================\n * COMPATIBILITY\n * ============================================================================\n *\n * | Token Type                      | OpenZeppelin | This Library |\n * |---------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n * | Standard ERC20 (returns true)   | ✅           | ✅           |\n * | Old tokens (no return value)    | ✅           | ✅           |\n * | Buggy tokens (returns false)    | ❌           | ✅           |\n * | Fee-on-transfer tokens          | ✅           | ✅           |\n * | TRON USDT                       | ❌           | ✅           |\n *\n * ============================================================================\n * KNOWN LIMITATIONS\n * ============================================================================\n *\n * 1.

Rebasing Tokens (stETH, AMPL, etc.):\n *    Balance may change independently of transfers due to rebasing.\n *    This library may not work correctly with rebasing tokens.\n *\n * 3. ERC777/ERC1363 Callbacks:\n *    Tokens with transfer hooks could potentially manipulate balances.\n *    Use ReentrancyGuard in your contract when using this library.\n *\n * 4.
